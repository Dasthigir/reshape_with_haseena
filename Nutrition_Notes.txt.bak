Dieting and Nutrition Principles
1. Calorie Balance (=How much you eat)
2. MacroNutrient Amounts (=what you eat --> Protein + carbs + fats)
3. Nutrient Timings (=when you eat)
4. Food composition
5. Supplements

Calories :

	Food we eat are measured in the form of calories, Which are the energy indicators. The more calories we take more energy we get.
	If we don't consume the energy then our Calories will be converted into fat and is stored on muscle, liver for later use by ketogenclysis and the rest is stored as body fat.

	We need to balance our calories as per for need. They are basic building block of muscle tissues.

MacroNutrients: Protein, Carbohydrates and Dietary fat are the 3 nutirents which our body needs for functioning and they are needed in larger quantities.
		Protein:Protien and amino acids are the building blocks of our body. 1 gm of protien = 4 calories.
		Carbohydrates: They are main sources of enegy for our body. 1 gm of carbs = 4 calories.
		Dietary fats: They are essential for Harmone production and Vitamin absorbstion and brain fuction. 1 gm of fat = 9 calories
						Fats are of 3 types: Staturated fat
											 un staturated fats
											 trnas fats
											 
		Protein(explained in detail)
			This is formed by amino acids (there two types of amino acids esssential/non essential amnio acids). These amino acids help is muscle building.
			This helps in 1. Antibodies production
						  2. Making harmoes and enzymes
						  3. Digestion and absorption of food.
						  4. transport of oxygen to tissues
						  5. structure of muscles, tendons, organs, bones, hair & skin
						  6. Protein builds new muscle and saves exising muscle.
			When we take protien , 90% is broken into amino acids and 10% are used in digestion proceses.
			essential a acids cannot be produced by our body and it needs to be get from the food. These are important in muscle building.
			Non essential amino acids can be procuded by exising amino acids by resuing them.
			
			Maintaining ideal weight: Need to take 1 gm of protien per kg of body weight
			Muscle building and fat loss : need to take 1.5 to 2 gms of protein per kg weight
		Dietary fats(explained in detail)
			These produces essential fatty acids for our survival
			Regulates harmone production, keeps skin and hair healthy
			Helps vitamin A,D,K and E absorption(Fat soluble vitamins)
			Fat cells keep us warm
			
			Fats are of mainly two types 1. Saturated fats 2. unstaturated fats.
				1. Staturated fats: These are bad fats and increases LDL levels and causes hearth diseases. THese are produded from animal sources.
				2. unstaturated fats: these are from plant based.
				3. Trans fats: these are formed by infusing hydrogen to vegetable oils, these will make food to stay for more time
				
			To healthy body we need 0.7 grams of fat for 1 kg of fat free body(Muscle,water,bone). 
			So 15-20% of total calories per day we need from FAT.
			So prefer Mono& poly unsaturated fats over saturated fat. Avoid trans fat.
			Suppose if we are filled up needed protein,carbs and fats still we are calorie deficient as per our daily need, Prefer to increase FAT due to following reasons.
				1. Health Benefits: Mono unstaurated fats are good for health such as olive,Avacado, Seed oils, Nuts. 
				2. These taste better
				3. 1 gm of fat = 9 calories, but cards and protien has only 4 calories
				4. Cheap in rate.
		Carbohydrates (explained in detail)
			Carbohydrates are the union of Sugar moluces (Carbon+hydrogen+oxygen)
			1. Hight carbs are broken into glucose
			2. Glucose will be transported throughout the body to provide energy.
			3. Excess glucose is stored in liver and muscles as glycogen or as fat.
			
			When we go for high intense workouts our body uses Glycogen and converts it back to glucose for new fuel.
			Suppiles fule to nurveos system
			Secrets insluin
			
			DIfferent types of Carbs:
				1. Monosaccharides : one sugar molecule (Gulcose,galactose,fructose)
				2. Disaccharides : two sugar molecule (surcose, lactose,maltose)
				3. polysaccharides: several sugar molecules (pasta,potatoses,grains, fiber)
				
					simple carbs : mono and disaccharides
					complex carbs : polysaccharides
					
			Glycemic Index: This is the measurment of how quickly carbs are converted to glucose
			so, foods which digest quickly will have High GI and foods which digest slowely have less GI.
			
				Low GI foos ( 55 or less) : non starchy Vegetables,oat meal,sweet potatoses,corn,peas
				Medium ( 56 -69) : Whole wheat, rice, Quick Oats,
				High (70 or above) : Whilte bread, corn flakes, puffed rice, pumpkin, popcorn, pineapple
				
				Whole, unprocessed carbs are Good carbs and processed carbs are bad carbs
				
				If we need to be fat then taking surplus calorie by taking high protein or high fat diet.
				
				In simple, If we are working hard then we need to take carbs from quility sources along with protien and fat
						   if we are not working then taking less carbs from quality sources along with protien and fat.
						   
						   
		When to Eat these Macro Nutrients:
			Protein: Protein is formed from amino acids whcih basically helps to keepup our muscles
					 Protein digestion is how fast out food releases amino acids
						Whey protein releases amino acids is less than an hour
						Food proteins will take few hours
						Daiery protiens will take upto 7 hours
						If we take protein with fiber and Fat it will take more to digest protein
			Carbs: We need to take carbs before and after carbs , as it give energy to our body. 
				   Carbs will increase the insluin level which inturn reduces the disgestion of Protein.
			Fats: We need to avoid fats before workouts as it slow downs digestion of both protein and carbs. So eating fats will help in fasting.
			
	Food sources: Avoid trans fats, maintain vitamins, minerals, carbs, fats and protein
			Protein sources: Whey protein, Eggs, Meats, Poultry, sea food, Soya, beans, nuts
			Carbs sources: Get 80 -90% carbs from high fiber minimal processed foods as Oats meal,rice, protatoes,whole grains,fruits and vegetables
			Fats: 1/3 of fat intake from Monounssaturated fats(Avacado,Nuts,nut butter & olive oil)
				  1/3 of fat intake from polyunstaturated fats (vegetable oils)
				  1/3 of fat intake from staturated fats (butter,cheese,bacon,eggs,animal fats) 
				  Avoid trans fat
				  
***** Energy Metabolism
			Primary energy molucle is ATP(Adenosine Triphosphate)
			When Muscle contract cells break down ATP which releases energy and it lasts only for 3 - 4 secs
			--> Problem: Cells can store only enough ATP for a few seconds
			
			To produce more ATP by breaking down creatine phosphate. So creatine supplement create phospate store which in trun store more ATP.
			
			Even this creatine phospate can last only for 10 - 15 sec, then our body finds other ways of energy sources such as "aerobically(with air)"
			and "anaerobically (without air)"
			
			Our body produces new ATP in two sources with oxygen (aerobically) and without oxygen(anaerobically), there are 3 paths of this
				1. Anareobic Glycolysis (carbs without oxygen)
						breakdown of carbs without oxygen which releases energy rapidly 
						cons: Less efficeint than aerobic as only 2-3 ATP for 1 glucose molecule
							  if no oxygen is available pyruvate chemical is converted to acid which creates buring sensation
				2. Arebobic Glycolysis (carbs with oxygen)
						Breakdown of carbs with oxygen , it release 32 ATP for 1 glucose molecule
						cons: slower than anaerobic glycolysis
				3. Lipolysis (fat with oxygen)
						Breakdown of fat(triglycarides) stored in fat tissues with oxygen for energy.
						fatty acids and glycerol molecules are then metabolized to generate new ATP
			Conclusion: During high intensity workouts carbs will produce more energy without oxygen diet to be included , so carbs to be included for athelates
			
***** Food digestion
		Through digestion our foods gives protien,fats and carbs,vitamins,minerals
			Protein is broken down to amino acids
			fats are broken into fatty acids and glycerol
			carbohydrates are broken into simple sugar molecules
		
		Digestive system is formed by gastronal and testronal glands along with liver, pancreas and gall bladder,mouth, suffugs,small intestine, mouth
		
		When we chew food and mix with saliva, saliva includes enzymes that starts breaking down the food, tounge pueshes the food into throat where it passes
			through esophagues(tube from mouth to intestine) and reaches stomach. Once the food reaches stomach it mixes with digestive jucies which further 
			breaks down and kills bacteria.
			
			liquid mixture is called chyme and then sent into small intestine, this is where most of food abosprtion will happen
			
			Small intenstine walls will have small finger like tissues that absorbs water and chyme's nutrients
			
			Waste products of digestive process move into large intestine
