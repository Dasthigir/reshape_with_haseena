Thyroid gland is the 
	first gland formed in our body.
	
our body is dependent on thyroid gland,
	As this effects the metabolism.
	So what ever we eat to break down it and getting it converted into energy is done by thyriod gland
	Regulates the body temparature
	Regulates heart rate and blood flow
	helps in calcium absorbstion and bone growth
    Brain development
	reprodctive/Uterine system
	
Thyroid glad
	Produces 3 hormones by getting signals form brain to pitutary
		T3 : Produces through iodine rich food and Thryoxin (essential amino acid), with vitamin C, B6, Selenium, Fatty acids
			T3 is the most active form of thyroid hormone. It is made from thyroxine (T4) by the liver and kidneys. T3 helps regulate metabolism, growth, and development.
		T4 : T4 is the main form of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It is not as active as T3, but it is converted to T3 in the body. T4 helps regulate metabolism, growth, and development.
		Calcitonin : Calcitonin is a hormone that helps regulate calcium levels in the blood. It is produced by the thyroid gland, but it is not considered to be a thyroid hormone.

If T3,T4 are not produced in the body, Then our pituitary gland will produce more TSH which is called Hypo thyroidism
