1. Gulten free diet:
		Gulten is naturally occuring composite of two protiens (gliadin and Glutenin) found in rye, wheat, barely products
		Gulten makes baked food products more elastic found in pizza dough, pasta, crackers etc
		Gulten cannot be broken by eat or directly digested, these will go to our GUT and may create autoimmue diseases, diarreha, bloating, gut issues and 
			this occurs to only people with celiac disease, which only 0.2% population have
		So Gulten free food is not good for every one as it will be less nutritious, lower in protein, higer in fat, cost more or double
		It will help in weight loss but it is unhealthy
2. Paleo diet:
		This diet is just eating what out cave man ate such as Frutis,veggies,meats,seafood and nuts 
		by avoiding Porcessed foods, dairy products, potatoes and grains
			(Cave has very less food and now we have enough food so not sure about the result)
		This is rich of protein with lean meat,seafood whcih helps in muscle building and mainting muscle mass
		Veggies and Fruits are rich in fiber, vitamins and rich in nutrition
		
		Avoids processed foods, trans fat.
		
		Problem with this is :
				Whole grains are banned
				Dairy products are banned
				some legumes are banned
